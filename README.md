# Study with Convolutional and Transformer Models on Ornamental Rock Datasets

This code was used in my master's degree.

The code is based on a Python notebook. There are several Python scripts to preprocess the images (preprocess_images.py), generate balanced datasets (generatebalanceddataset.py), and analyze the total number of images in the directories (analysetotalimages.py).

The file "CÃ³digo_artigo_2024.ipynb" contains the code used. It includes a main class, training_class_models(), which loads the models and images, trains the models, and then calls the test_model() method to evaluate the trained models on the test dataset.

The image directory must include the tree directories:
  - train
  - test
  - val

with each of them containing the same classes directories.

The code will generate two directories:
 - models
 - runs

The "models" directory save each model trained with the .pth file, a json file with the classes trained, another json file with the results and the confusion matrix image generated by the test process.
The "runs" directory stores the tensor board files that can be accessed by the tensor board. To start the tensor board and visualize the reports, execute:
    tensorboard --logdir "runs"
Inside the root directory of the code.
